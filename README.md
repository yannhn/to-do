# to-do

A simple ToDo app where you can set and check off your ToDos. You can also delete, edit and archive them.

**Link to project:** https://to-do-chi-green.vercel.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, styled-components

The app is split across three pages linked via React-Router which each hold different functionalities.

### Add ToDos

You can simply add new ToDos and also edit or delete existing ones. After completing a ToDo the user is able to archive them.

### Archive ToDos

A seperate page displaying every archived ToDo.

### Shuffle ToDos

If you don't know which ToDo to tackle first you can easily shuffle them which presents you a random ToDo.

## Lessons Learned:

The goal was to simply use CRUD Operations to front end. This allowed me to get to know and use the different methods better. Also, I was able to practice using react router to split the app into different pages.
